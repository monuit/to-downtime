# TCL Data Loading Optimization for Railway Deployment

## Problem
Server was hanging without logs during deployment on the "Running migration 005" step. This was due to:
1. **65,069 individual INSERT statements** - One round-trip per record (massive network overhead)
2. **Silent failures** - Only logger.info/debug, not visible to Railway stdout
3. **No progress indication** - Process appeared hung with no feedback

## Solution Implemented

### Performance: Batch Insert Strategy
```
BEFORE: 65,069 separate INSERTs (each with network round-trip)
AFTER:  ~130 batch INSERT statements (500 rows per batch)

Reduction: 50x fewer round-trips!
```

**Expected Performance Improvement:**
- Old approach: 5-10 minutes (likely to timeout)
- New approach: 30-60 seconds

### Logging Strategy for Railway
Added explicit `console.log()` with timestamps to all critical paths:

```typescript
// Visible in Railway deployment logs
console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ‚è≥ Inserted ${stored} / ${features.length} segments (${pct}%)`)
```

**Key Logging Points:**
1. Migration startup
2. Each migration completion (with duration)
3. TCL fetch initiation
4. Batch insert progress (every 500 rows, every 5000 rows)
5. Transaction commit/rollback
6. Overall completion

## Code Changes

### `tcl-fetcher.ts`
- ‚úÖ Changed individual INSERTs to multi-row INSERT batches
- ‚úÖ Added explicit BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK transaction handling
- ‚úÖ Added progress logging every 500 records (batch size) and 5000 records
- ‚úÖ All console.log outputs have ISO timestamps for Railway log parsing

### `migrations/index.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added console.log with timestamps before each migration
- ‚úÖ Each migration logs completion time
- ‚úÖ Overall summary at the end

### `startup.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added console.log timestamps for each startup phase
- ‚úÖ Database initialization, scheduler startup, server startup all logged

## Batch INSERT Implementation

Using PostgreSQL multi-row INSERT syntax:
```sql
INSERT INTO tcl_segments (...) VALUES 
  ($1, $2, ..., $13),
  ($14, $15, ..., $26),
  ...
  ($N-12, $N-11, ..., $N)
```

Benefits:
- Single database round-trip per 500 records
- Automatic transaction support (BEGIN/COMMIT)
- Memory efficient (only 500 objects in memory at a time)
- Queryable parameter binding (PostgreSQL handles it)

## Transaction Safety
```typescript
await client.query('BEGIN')
try {
  // ... batch inserts
  await client.query('COMMIT')
} catch (error) {
  await client.query('ROLLBACK')
  throw error
}
```

Ensures all-or-nothing semantics: if any batch fails, entire operation rolls back.

## Next Steps for Production
1. ‚úÖ Commit and push changes to Railway
2. ‚è≥ Monitor Railway logs during deployment - should see real-time progress
3. ‚è≥ Verify database has 65,069 TCL segments after deployment
4. ‚è≥ Check API endpoints return disruptions with TCL matches
5. ‚úÖ Set `LOG_LEVEL=verbose` if detailed ETL debugging needed
